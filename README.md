# Introduction 
Blockchain Connector is one of the components used by the Access Node to interact between off-chain storage and on-chain 
storage. It is a RESTFul API that provides a set of endpoints to interact with the Context Broker and Blockchain. 

It is built using Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x, and Gradle.

## Main features:
- Subscribe to new entities stored in the Context Broker. 
- Create Blockchain Events with the detailed data of the Context Broker Entity as attributes values. 
- Publish Blockchain Events to a configured Blockchain Node. 
- Query Blockchain Events to the Blockchain Node using Event Metadata as filters. 
- Retrieve Entity Data using the ‘data location’ attribute of the Blockchain Event. 
- Publish retrieved Entities to the configured Context Broker.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)
- [Orion-LD](https://github.com/FIWARE/context.Orion-LD/blob/develop/doc/manuals-ld/installation-guide-docker.md)

## Application profiles 
- <b>*Default*</b>: this profile is only used to execute test during the CI/CD pipeline.
- <b>DEV</b>: this profile is used to execute the application in a Docker container.

## API references (DEV environment)
- Swagger: http://localhost:8280/swagger-ui.html
- OpenAPI: http://localhost:8280/api-docs

## Installing
- Clone Blockchain Connector project and Alastria Red T to your local machine. 
```git clone https://dev.azure.com/in2Dome/DOME/_git/in2-dome-blockchain_connector```
```git clone https://dev.azure.com/in2Dome/DOME/_git/in2-test-alastria_red_t```
- Open/Run Docker Desktop
- Navigate to the root folder of the in2-test-alastria_red_t and execute the docker-compose. This will execute the Alastria Red T that consists in 6 local nodes (1 boot, 1 regular, and 4 validators).
```cd in2-test-alastria_red_t```
```docker-compose up -d```
- Navigate to the root folder of the in2-dome-blockchain_connector and build the docker image. This will execute the Blockchain Connector Solution.
```cd in2-dome-blockchain_connector```
```docker build -t blockchain-connector .```
- Navigate to the root folder of the in2-dome-blockchain_connector/docker and execute the docker-compose. This will execute the Blockchain Connector Solution, the Orion Context Broker, and the MongoDB linked to Context Broker
```cd in2-dome-blockchain_connector/docker```
```docker-compose up -d```
